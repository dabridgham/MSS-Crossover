= MSS Crossover

A KiCad project for a circuit board that implements an
https://www.modularsignalsystem.info/index.html[MSS] Crossover node.
It includes the block detection circuit and the crossover wiring
between two RJ45 connectors.

== Notes

The ``aux`` screw terminal is there to give you access to the
``local`` and ``gnd`` signals from MSS.  If you have, say, a spur off
the mainline then you want to be able to assert ``local`` when the
turnout is thrown.  A contact closure from your switch machine to the
``aux`` screw terminal handles this.

Alternately, you might want access to the block detection signal for
some other purpose as well as MSS.  In that case, the ``aux`` screw
terminal acts as an output of that signal.  Diode D4 acts to separate
this block detection from all the others in this MSS block.  That is,
the ``aux`` output will only indicate this one detector.  If you don't
want that, solder a wire jumper in place of D4.
